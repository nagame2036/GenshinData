# GenshinData
Repository containing the game data for the game Genshin Impact.

As of update 1.6.0 performed on the 6/7/2021 there might be wrong names or inconsistency on specific or rare fields, more specifically when there's not enough data to analyze and will mostly be seen on boolean fields. Due to the nature of the process we use to dump stuff *(which is fully automatic without manual input every patch)* there's not much that can be done. Apologies for that, the drama in March harmed this repository too.

This repository is a work between Falzar and I. Use it for whatever you want as long as you don't put words in our mouth.

BinOutput had a lot of useless content manually stripped by me, which also includes unreleased content to prevent misinformation. If you feel something should be there and it isn't, please let me know.
